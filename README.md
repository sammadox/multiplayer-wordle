# Multiplayer Wordle for Suavex

It is safe to assume most of us have been exposed to the viral game Wordle where people take attempts at guessing the word where feedback is given for each attempt showing which letters of the attempted guess are present/not present in the word to be guessed.
It is a superfun game to play and it jogs your brain and test your own vocabulary(scrabble skills maybe).

Having been a big fan of the game, I wanted to create a web based game where you could battle against your friend taking turns to guess the word.

## Frontend

The front end is made in React.


## Backend

The backend server is made using Node and Express.


## Communication

The frontend and backend communicate via Socket IO rooms and events.



# How to play

Use this [link](multiplayer-wordle-game.onrender.com) to enter the game. Fill your username and click on Create Room.

Share the room code and the game link with your friend.

Battle it out by taking turns and see who comes up ahead.

Have fun and use your own strategies to win. ðŸ˜œ
